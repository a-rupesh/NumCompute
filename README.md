# NumCompute

NumCompute is a lightweight, modular, NumPy-based scientific computing toolkit built for the Programming in AI course.

The project implements reusable, vectorised numerical components from scratch using only plain Python and NumPy. It focuses on numerical correctness, clean API design, testing, and reproducible benchmarking.

---

## Project Goals

This toolkit is designed to provide:

- reusable NumPy-based components
- vectorised implementations where possible
- clean and consistent APIs
- strong edge-case handling
- unit tests and reproducible benchmarks
